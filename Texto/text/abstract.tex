The development of new real-time applications and the crescent increase data production combined with the disparity in performance between 
processor and memory is a major challenge for softwares designers and developers.
In this context, it becomes essential to effectively use the higher levels of hierarchy of memory, where the time spent to complete a processor 
request is less and the storage capacity is reduced;  the effective use of this hierarchy can take place through the succinct data structures, 
which allow the representation and operation on a set of data efficiently,  while allowing the management of this data in faster memories and with 
less storage capacity.\\
The Range min-Max tree (rmM-tree) is an example of the success of these structures, built in the form of a complete binary tree, the rmM-tree occupies 
about $n + O (\frac {n} {b} \log n)$ bits, and makes it possible to perform operations on the objects it represents in time $O(\log n)$. 
Although this structure has theoretically satisfactory computational cost, due to its low branching factor, a large number of data transfers between 
cache and RAM can occur, our objective in this work is to minimize the number of possible cache misses, maximizing the amount of data sent with each 
transfer. 
Thus, this work focuses on the study of the classical Range min-Max tree interval and on optimizing the use of the cache by this structure, 
increasing its number of branches.
